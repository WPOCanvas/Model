## Why
"What gets measured gets done" is a well-known statement. Measurements are a great tool to track the progress of your business objectives. Tracking your progress against key metrics helps to take decisions for improvements. They act as evidence of the claim or prediction.

## How
Consider the following steps for defining key matrices:

- **Understanding business goals:** Your matrices should track the progress towards the ultimate business goal. The first step is to identify the business goals as quantifiable as possible. E.g. 1 billion dollar sales revenue by the end of 2021.
- **Defining matrices for the product:** 
    1.	**Process Metrics:** Improves the efficiency of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
    2. 	**Quality Metrics:** It is important to define metrics in order to help you ensure you are delivering acceptable products to your customer. Metrics could provide insights into test progress and quality of your product. Additionally, they serve as an input to decision making. 
        Here are some metrics that could help add value to your Quality Assurance process:
          - **Test Effectiveness:** This metric helps you identify whether the test cases you maintain are effective such that they capture bugs. A high-test effectiveness percentage indicates that you have a good test set that would require less test case maintenance effort long-term. 
          - **Test Coverage:** This metric helps you identify How much of the software was covered during testing.
          - **Test Execution Status:** This is a snapshot of the total number of tests passed, failed, blocked, not executed. You could share these charts with stakeholders as this is a visual aid that would help communicate progress.
          - **Defect Density:** Defect density can be defined as the number of defects per size of the software or application area. 
          - **Defect Severity Index:** This metric considers the weighted average of defect severity.
          - **Defect Distribution Charts:** Defects can be categorized based on type, root cause, severity, module , environment etc. This categorization would help understand the distribution of defects and identify areas where defect removal could be improved
          - **Defect Leakage ratio:** This metric helps you identify the defects that are not detected during testing phases before a production release.                     
    3. 	**Project Metrics:** Improves the efficiency of the project team.
    The chances are that you'll have objectives to measure in all these areas. Try breaking down the big objective in each area to more trackable progressive milestones. Depending on your business objectives the weightages for each milestone may differ.
    
- **Identifying Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** The most critical measures out of those defined are the Key Performance Indicators. These are the ones that businesses define as most applicable for success. KPIs needs to be established based on the business goals. Once identified, then they need to be communicated to all stakeholders of the organization.
- **Aligning individuals with business goals:** One of the most effective ways of management is to align the business goals with individual objectives. This is primarily about communicating the company objectives and making sure individuals follow company objectives as a part of their daily activities.
- **Progress tracking:** Matrices are ineffective if the progress is not tracked. There should be mechanisms in place to track the progress continuously.
- **Continuous improvement:** The entire purpose of key matrices is to identify inefficiencies, learn from them and continuously improve. Failures are likely to happen and your organization should be tough enough to learn from them and most importantly to make sure not to repeat the same mistakes.
