checklist: 
  -
    order: 1
    question: Is there an established product road map?
    expectation: All team members should be aware of the product road map. Road map should clearly indicate the upcoming features and their time lines.
    version: 1.0.0

    order: 2
    question: Is there a process to get customer feedback?
    expectation: A clear process should be in place to get customer feedback of the product. This feedback ideally needs to be captured during the development phase it self by involving customer in early prototypes.

    question: How are the features prioritized?
    expectation: Features needs to be prioritized based on user preference data. There has to be evidence of collecting this data from the customers.

## Why
The main intention of a requirement process is to confirm that the correct requirements are captured. A product should ultimately solve customers' need. That’s why investigating and capturing the right requirement is crucial. It’s about finding what users are willing to pay for. The captured requirements need to be documented to help with information retention and communication. This also act as evidence for any further clarification.

The idea is to build a Win-Win strategy with product users. The product team should focus on identifying users’ problem and ensure they do what it takes to get their problem solved.

## How
The following tips can help you with the requirement process:
- **Early customer feedback:** Focus on getting feedback from users as early as possible in the development cycle. Ensure the investment on development is spent on features that customers are willing to pay for. Using the Lo/High fidelity prototypes that were discussed earlier, focus on getting users feedback on feature importance and tips on usage improvements long before even the development starts.
- **Customer Involvement:** Include customers in the development life cycle. Have specialized people who work with customers and use this input for feature prioritization and ultimately to define the product road map. It’s important to be transparent about this with your customer to think Win-Win.
- **Data driven:** The decisions made on the product road map and the feature prioritization needs to be derived from data analysis. Customer requirements needs to be scientifically obtained with a large enough data set to make decisions on what features benefit the entire customer base.
- **Product road map:** Requirement process is the journey of converting users' needs into product requirements. It’s important to translate requirements captured earlier into features that the product team understands and finally prioritize them to a product road map based on potential gains and feasibility. The product road map then needs to be communicated to all stakeholders of the company.
- **Categorization of Requirements:** Categorize your requirements into functional, non-functional and UI for a more detailed analysis of requirements 
  - Functional requirements: Requirements that define functions and functionality of the system
  - Non-Functional requirements: Implicit characteristics of the system such as Security, Logging, Storage, Configuration, Performance, Interoperability, Flexibility, Accessibility
  - UI Requirements: Consider asking yourself questions like is the system easy to operate? Is the system responsive? Are operational errors handled effectively? Is the user interface simple? Is the user interface consistent?
 - **Requirement Validation:** Requirements could be validated by the help of prototypes. Prototypes serve as a defect detection tool as they help the team identify issues upfront. Prototypes could be tested and evaluated against the original requirements.
 - **Requirement Traceability Matrix:** This is a high-level document that could be used to map and trace user requirements (both functional and non-functional) with test cases to ensure that for each and every requirement, adequate level of testing is being achieved. It could also be used as a baseline document to be referred to when determining whether issues with the solution are to be treated as defects or change requests.
